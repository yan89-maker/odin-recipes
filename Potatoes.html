    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic,

        saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture,
        blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are
        smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper. Serve and enjoy!</li>
